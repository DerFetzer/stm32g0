Since this counter counts down, this operation effectively subtracts from (delays) the clock by: Delay (seconds) = SUBFS / (PREDIV_S + 1) A fraction of a second can effectively be added to the clock (advancing the clock) when the ADD1S function is used in conjunction with SUBFS, effectively advancing the clock by: Advance (seconds) = (1 - (SUBFS / (PREDIV_S + 1))).
